########## K means cluster code challenge ############
######################################################

This document contain the instruction on how to use the K means clustering code.

Execution command: python code_kmean.py

Output:
1. 'Result.csv' file which contain the cluster id that each data point belong to.
2. 'cluster.jpeg' image of the final cluster distribution. If plot variable is 
	set to False then this image would not be saved.

############# Important variables ###########
plot (line no 9):  This is set to True if user wants to save the final plot in 
				   the form of a jpeg file. If set to False the image would not
				   be saved.

data (line no 10): Here in the current implementation the value provided is None
                   But in place of None a list of tuples can be used which should
				   be 2 dimensional. For example:  [(1.1, 2.5), (3.4,1.9)...]
				   
k (line no 18):	   Here variable k is the number of clusters which is to be created.

iterations (line no 19): It is the number of updations of centroids before the final
						 result is saved in a form of csv file.
